1. Overview
You are now using UMLGibson, a full-featured UML class diagram editor. You know what it’s time for: diagramming that project of yours with all the boxes and relationships you need.

2. The Menu
	2a. File: Here you can Save a diagram as a PDF, reset the diagram to a New diagram, and Exit the application.
	2b. View: Here you can Toggle Toolbox.
	2c. GibsonMode: Stop crying.
	2d. Help: You’re currently reading the Help file! About will tell you more about us.

3. The Toolbox
The toolbox is the brawn of UMLGibson. It is the what makes it a UML diagram editor.
	3a. Boxes: Click the box option and then again on the main canvas place a class box in that location.
		One type of box.
		Click the Select tool to grab and move class boxes.
	3b. Arrows: Click a relaionship arrow and then on two boxes to draw the arrow between the two automatically.
		Different types:
			Association: Standard arrow.
			Aggregation: Open diamond at end of line.
			Composition: Closed diamond at end of line.
			Implementation: Open arrow at end of dotted line.
			Generalization: Open arrow.
			Dependency: Dotted arrow.
			
4. The Canvas
	You can move around boxes around the canvas as expected with the move tool. The canvas itself can be scrolled on. The Save function saves a screencap of it.

4. Gibson Mode
	No!!! We're not giving details.
	
5. License
	That's a great question. Most of us have driver's licenses.
